# MediocreCardGame
A simple singleplayer card game

This project is a simple rudimentary card game. It offers two variations of the card game you can play.
Both game modes pit the player against a CPU player, where the player and CPU will take turns playing cards and "defending" against each others's cards
______________________________
HOW TO PLAY:
Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards. Each player takes turns playing cards. During a player's turn, the player will play a single card from their hand. This is called an "offensive turn".
After a card is played, the other player will get a chance to "defend" by playing one of their cards from their hand, which will reduce the value of their opponent's played card.
After the second player plays their defense, the first player will earn an amount of points corresponding to the value of their played card minus their opponent's played card.
If the defense's played card's value is higher than the offense's played card, the card will act completely the same as a card of the same value as the offense's card.
"Wild" cards are cards that have a value of zero when played on an offensive turn, but can completely block any card when played on a defensive turn.

HOW THE GAME WORKS:
The game deck is based off of the standard 52-card deck.
In the "classic" game mode, each player draws from their own deck.
In the "shared" game mode, each player draws from the same deck.
